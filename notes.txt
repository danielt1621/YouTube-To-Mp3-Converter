To run js on so you can run the server:
- Open terminal
- npm init (only to create a new .js project)
- node app.js (run the sever either on port 300 || heroku git)





Ideas for the website
- *Look if there is a way to search items from Youtube from inside the website*
- Add contact form with nodemailer
- Add simple animations
- Add frameworks to add nice css items
- Insure it's mobile firendly
- Look if there is any way to mask the link
- Create a contact form
- Create an in-line nav-menu (maybe it's not necessary)
- Try to find a way to redirect user to different paages
